      <p>Flamingos are one of the most interesting types of animals in the world. There are six known species of them out there.
        They are different from many other types of birds because of the length of their legs. They arenâ€™t often seen flying
        but they certainly can just like other birds. It was long debated though if they should be classified as storks or
        ducks. Finally, it was decided that they should have their own classification.</p>
